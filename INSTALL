How to build
------------

AutoUPnP uses a simple Makefile for the build procedure. In order
to build the library, call:
$ make

The following environment variables are respected by the Makefile:

* CC (the compiler executable)
* CFLAGS (the compiler flags used for compiling)
* LDFLAGS (the compiler flags used for linking)


Dependencies
------------

The only obligatory requirement is a POSIX-compatible standard C library
implementation (or at least one providing POSIX sockets, dl*() family
of functions, syslog(), snprintf() [C99] and pthread functions).

If the C library doesn't come with pthread support nor even mutex/rwlock
function stubs, AutoUPnP can use libpthread-stubs instead (from xorg).

If available, AutoUPnP will use IPPROTO_* constants and GNU RTLD_NEXT
dlsym() extension.

Additionally, AutoUPnP can use libnotify if it's available via
pkg-config. If you want to disable it, you need to override the
WANT_LIBNOTIFY macro:
$ make WANT_LIBNOTIFY=false


How to install
--------------

Simply copy (or move) the 'autoupnp.so' library into a libdir of your
choice. If you like, you may copy 'autoupnp' wrapper script to a bindir
too.

If you want to have AutoUPnP enabled by default, you'd probably like to
add:
	. autoupnp on
into your ~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile, /etc/profile or a similar file
of your choice. It is important to source the script as it needs to
export the LD_PRELOAD var to the current environment.
