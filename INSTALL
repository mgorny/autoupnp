How to build
------------

AutoUPnP uses a simple Makefile for the build procedure. In order
to build the library, call:
$ make

The following environment variables are respected by the Makefile:

* CC (the compiler executable)
* CFLAGS (the compiler flags used for compiling)
* LDFLAGS (the compiler flags used for linking)


Dependencies
------------

The only obligatory requirement is a POSIX-compatible standard C library
implementation (or at least one providing POSIX sockets, dl*() family
of functions, syslog() and snprintf() [C99]).

If available, AutoUPnP will use IPPROTO_* constants and GNU RTLD_NEXT
dlsym() extension.

Additionally, AutoUPnP can use libnotify if it's available via
pkg-config. If you want to disable it, you need to override the
WANT_LIBNOTIFY macro:
$ make WANT_LIBNOTIFY=false


How to install
--------------

Simply copy (or move) the 'autoupnp.so' library into a libdir of your
choice. Then add the LD_PRELOAD (re)definition wherever you want to use
it -- either in one of the profile files, application startup scripts,
.desktop definitions...
